The world is changing a lot..As of today ( MAR 23,2020) Humanity is facing a grave existensial crisis from a tiny,oblique,none heard of Virus...Who would have thought that whole world is headed for lockdown with humans under house aka Cages giving free hand for the wildlife to be restore of their original glory.. Lets face it ! This is not the first time humans have faced challenges and this is not the last time we are facing as well..Lets overcome this...

I am pursuing ML/DL in quest to upgrade myself technically and testing my waters in the challenging field..No doubt this field has tremendous oppurtunities and in the course of purusal, i am learnng myself of many things which i missed to learn during school/college days..
